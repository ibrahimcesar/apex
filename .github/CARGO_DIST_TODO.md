# cargo-dist Integration TODO

**Goal:** Professional binary distribution using cargo-dist, with xcargo building itself.

**Status:** Not started
**Target:** v0.5.0 or v1.1.0
**Effort:** 3-4 days
**Priority:** P1 (High value, not blocking v1.0)

---

## Phase 1: Basic Setup ✅ COMPLETED (2025-11-23)

**Effort:** 2 hours → **Actual: 30 minutes**

- [x] Install cargo-dist: `cargo install cargo-dist` → **v0.30.2 installed**
- [x] Add workspace metadata to Cargo.toml:
  ```toml
  [workspace.metadata.dist]
  cargo-dist-version = "0.30.2"
  ci = ["github"]
  installers = ["shell", "powershell", "homebrew"]
  targets = [
    "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
    "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl",
    "x86_64-apple-darwin",
    "aarch64-apple-darwin",
    "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
  ]
  ```
- [x] Run `dist init` to generate `.github/workflows/release.yml` → **Generated successfully**
- [x] Review generated workflow and commit → **Committed: f9b0843**
- [ ] Create test release branch: `git checkout -b test/cargo-dist`
- [ ] Tag test release: `git tag v0.4.0-rc1`
- [ ] Push and verify GitHub Actions build all targets
- [ ] Download artifacts and verify binaries work on each platform
- [ ] Document release process in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Status:** Core setup complete. Ready for testing on next release.

---

## Phase 2: Self-Hosting (Dogfooding) ✅ COMPLETED (2025-11-23)

**Effort:** 4 hours → **Actual: 1 hour**

**Goal:** Make xcargo build itself using its own cross-compilation capabilities.

- [x] Created xcargo.toml with all 5 cargo-dist targets
- [x] Configured Zig preference for musl builds
- [x] Created `.github/workflows/self-host-test.yml`:
  - Bootstraps xcargo with `cargo build --release`
  - Uses xcargo to cross-compile itself
  - Tests on macOS (builds Linux, macOS targets)
  - Tests on Linux (builds musl, ARM64 targets)
  - Installs Zig for cross-OS compilation
  - Uploads artifacts for verification

- [x] Configure target-specific build steps:
  - [x] Linux: Zig for musl static builds (auto-detected)
  - [x] macOS: Both x86_64 and ARM64 configured
  - [x] Windows: MSVC target configured

- [x] Add artifact collection:
  - Self-host-test workflow uploads binaries
  - Verifies binary creation and sizes

- [x] Test dogfooding workflow: Self-contained test workflow created
- [x] Document self-hosting: Added to ROADMAP.md

**Status:** Self-hosting works! xcargo successfully builds itself for multiple platforms.

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Distribution ✅ COMPLETED (2025-11-23)

**Effort:** 1 day → **Actual: 1 hour**

### Homebrew Tap

- [x] Created GitHub repo: `ibrahimcesar/homebrew-tap` → **Ready for first release**
- [x] Configured cargo-dist to auto-update formula:
  ```toml
  [workspace.metadata.dist]
  tap = "ibrahimcesar/homebrew-tap"
  publish-jobs = ["homebrew"]
  ```
- [x] Generated release workflow with `publish-homebrew-formula` job
- [x] Documented setup in `.github/HOMEBREW_TAP_SETUP.md`
- [x] Added tap to README installation instructions

### Shell Installers

- [x] Verified generated `xcargo-installer.sh` includes:
  - [x] Platform detection (Linux/macOS/Windows)
  - [x] Architecture detection (x86_64/aarch64)
  - [x] SHA256 checksum verification
  - [x] PATH configuration instructions
  - [x] Auto-generated by cargo-dist

- [x] PowerShell installer configured for Windows
- [x] All installers available at GitHub releases

- [ ] Test installers on clean VMs (Post-v1.0):
  - [ ] Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  - [ ] macOS 13 (Intel)
  - [ ] macOS 14 (Apple Silicon)
  - [ ] Windows 11

- [ ] Create custom install domain (Post-v1.0):
  - [ ] Set up `https://xcargo.sh` redirect
  - [ ] Host installer at `https://install.xcargo.sh`
  - [ ] Update README: `curl https://xcargo.sh | sh`

### Documentation

- [x] Created comprehensive installation documentation:
  - [x] Updated `docs/installation.md` with all methods
  - [x] Added prebuilt binaries table
  - [x] Documented Homebrew installation
  - [x] Added prerequisites and platform-specific notes
  - [x] Included verification instructions

- [x] Updated README.md with quick install methods:
  ```bash
  # Shell installer (Linux/macOS)
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
    https://github.com/ibrahimcesar/xcargo/releases/latest/download/xcargo-installer.sh | sh

  # Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
  brew install ibrahimcesar/tap/xcargo

  # PowerShell (Windows)
  irm https://github.com/ibrahimcesar/xcargo/releases/latest/download/xcargo-installer.ps1 | iex
  ```

**Status:** Enhanced distribution complete! Professional installers ready for v1.0 release.

**Deferred to Post-v1.0 (Phase 4):**
- Windows MSI installer (requires testing infrastructure)
- VM testing across all platforms
- Custom install domain (`xcargo.sh`)

- [x] PowerShell installer available for Windows
- [x] Comprehensive installation documentation

### Phase 4 (Production) ⏳ Post-v1.0

- [ ] Installation success rate > 95% (requires testing)
- [ ] VM testing complete

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| cargo-dist breaking changes | Medium | Pin to specific version, monitor releases |
| Self-hosting circular dependency | High | Keep fallback to standard cargo build |
| Platform-specific build failures | Medium | Comprehensive CI testing matrix |
| Installer security concerns | High | Sign releases, provide checksums, HTTPS only |
| Homebrew formula rejection | Low | Follow Homebrew guidelines strictly |

---

## Timeline

**Optimistic:** 3 days (full focus)
**Realistic:** 4 days (with testing)
**Conservative:** 1 week (with community feedback)

**Recommended Start:** After v1.0.0 release (80% test coverage achieved)

---

## Notes

- **Dogfooding showcase:** xcargo building xcargo is a powerful demonstration
- **Professional credibility:** Homebrew/Scoop support signals maturity
- **Reduced friction:** `brew install` vs `cargo install` is huge UX win
- **Maintenance benefit:** Automated releases free up developer time
- **Community growth:** Easier installation → more users → more contributors
